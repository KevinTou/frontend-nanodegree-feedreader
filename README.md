# RSS Feed Reader Testing

This project was to implement a set of tests, using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), against a pre-existing application. The idea of the project is to get into the mindset of creating a set of tests, which initially fail, and eventually making them pass the tests. 

## Installation/Usage

You can clone the project using:

```shell
$git clone https://github.com/KevinTou/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
